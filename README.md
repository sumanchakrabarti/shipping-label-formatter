Make my shipping labels fit my laser-printer paper

## Problem
I've gotten sick of printing an entire sheet of paper for a shipping label and I'd like it to have an adhesive built into it already. The problem is that shipping labels are poorly designed and tend to be centered in a PDF. Well, I want it to be cropped and to be able to buy cheap adhesive paper on Amazon and the like, so I made this app (vibe-coded it).

## Solution
1. Upload the PDF or image and choose which side of the page it should be on.
2. Ensure that it is setup to auto-crop to the border outline.
3. Click download.

## Why the different languages?
Pick your poison to start from. They're all the same, though the Swift app is more challenging to test.
